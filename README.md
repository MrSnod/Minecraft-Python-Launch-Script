# Minecraft Server Installer with QoL Mods
This script should allow you to quickly and easily install a Minecraft server with the latest version of Minecraft and the Fabric loader. It also offers the option to install 4 quality of life mods to enhance your server experience.
To use the script, simply run it and provide the path where you want the server to be installed. You will then be asked to accept the Minecraft EULA and whether you want to install the quality of life mods. If you choose to install the mods, they will be downloaded and placed in a "mods" directory within the server installation directory.

After the server is downloaded, update.py should update the server when it is run.
